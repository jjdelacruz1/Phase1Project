## General Information & Project Goals

For our phase one project, we decided to build a simple web application as a team of three, called Happy Hour Finder. The premise of the web app is to help users find local happy hours by searching by either zip code or city.

**Project Goals**
- Integrate two remote APIs using AJAX
- Use another JS library that is not jQuery
- Deploy our project elsewhere besides Github pages
- Learn how to break code into different files or modules

## Setup

Clone repository and open homepage.html

## Technologies Used

- Bootstrap 4
- Mapbox and Yelp APIs
- HTML & CSS
- Bideo.js

## Features

- Working search

## Our Process

- WIP

## Status

## What We Learned

- Breaking up our code into different files/modules so that they're easier to reuse as well decreasing merge conflicts
- Integrating APIs that require authentication
