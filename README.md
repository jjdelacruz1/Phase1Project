# Phase1Project
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jjdelacruz1/Phase1Project.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jjdelacruz1/Phase1Project)
Our Phase 1 Project is a site that will help users find the BEST happy hour near you!

Our group is composed of Alvin Ng, Jerome Dela Cruz, and Sue Park.

We will be using the moment.js, google maps, and yelp APIs for this project.

It will be initiated as well using bootstrap. 

BTW this is a forever changing README until the end of the project!
