## General Information & Project Goals

For our phase one project, we decided to build a simple web application as a team of three, called Happy Hour Finder. The premise of the web app is to help users find local happy hours by searching with either their zip code or city. Here is the link to our site: http://happyhourfinder.surge.sh

**Project Goals**
- Integrate two remote APIs using AJAX
- Use another JS library that is not jQuery
- Deploy our project elsewhere besides Github pages
- Learn how to break code into different files or modules

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:
`npm run deploy`
which deploys the application to Surge. 

## Technologies Used

- Bootstrap 4
- Mapbox and Yelp APIs
- HTML & CSS
- Travis CI 
- Bideo.js

## Features

- Working search feature
- Results page that renders results from Yelp's API
- Interactive map from Mapbox that include markers that reflect the information from the search results

## Our Process

- WIP

## Status

- WIP

## What We Learned

- Breaking up our code into different files/modules so that they're easier to reuse as well helping to decrease the chance of merge conflicts
- Integrating APIs that require authentication

**Challenges We Came Across**

Many of the challenges we encountered pertained to the app's search feature such as:
- Figuring out how to make the search results appear on an actual 'results' page
- Looking into why the search wasn't working on the results page, while it works fine on the homepage
